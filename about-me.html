		<p> Keeping it seriously simple aka KISS is how I lived my life since a little girl. I enjoy living, learning and creating. I have been on a variety of learning paths since coming out of my mother's womb. For six and a half decades I read and heard about success and failure. Many lessons let me see warning signs in advance to avoid danger and/or harm, as well as good examples that inspired me to be the best I can be. I learned using my natural five senses: hearing, seeing, tasting, touching and smelling. Learning was done at home, school, work and via playing. Many lessons were learned via others and on my very own. Learning how to spell words correctly from first grade allowed me to be able to read, write, comprehend, and to communicate with others effectively.</p>

		<p> Getting grades on report cards let me and my parents see my progress. Getting grades all throughout my life let me see what I learned correctly and what needed to be improved. As an adult, the grading system branched off into areas such as credit score ratings, driving ratings for auto insurance companies, health record ratings, just to name a few. Lots of time was put into learning that required my attention, focus and dedication. I had so much fun learning and it has been exciting, adventurous and challenging. Learning throughout my entire life brought out my inner creative juices and has been very rewarding. Many of my dreams came true by learning various subjects and skills. What started out as a hobby, became my lifelong passion and love. Putting learning and training skills together allowed me to get lots of jobs and own and operate a technology business in my birth city, New Orleans, Louisiana, name Octopus Productions Audio, Video, Music, Photo, Data Technology LLC. Learning has been a non-stop desire. It is never too late to learn.</p>
